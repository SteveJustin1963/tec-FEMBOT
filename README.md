### Warning
A very hard and complex and ill structured project that will see you apprehend for lack of moral values


Every n00b and nerd finds himself enamoured with the need to create his female cyborg Fembot, crafted from anatomically precise silicon wonders and junk parts, hacked together late in the night, surpassing all boundaries in the name of loveâ€¦

- cyborg human-like interaction capabilities,
- utilising MINT programming language,
- AI technologies,
- and reinforcement learning
- achieve seamless, adaptive behaviours.


### Design
- hack together skeletal framework, joints, add motors, air muscles etc
- add silicone or TPE skin, breasts, vagina, but etc
- add a beautiful scifi inspired head or whatever you can hack or knocks off
- motors and Actuators, servo motors etc arms, head, for legs maybe just use wheels
-  sensors
  - surface, to detect and react to external stimuli.
  - proximity, ultrasonic sensor, distance, avoid
  - infrared sensors
  - gyroscope or accelerator meter for movement/ orientation


### code
- embedded mini PC running LLM with mic and speaker and interfaced to tec1
- MINT core logic functions. eg  `MOVE`, `SPEAK`, and `INTERACT`.
- `INIT` function to initialise basic operations.
- Set up loops (`/U`) for ongoing interaction and response.
- LLM can handle basic conversations,
- look into Interactive Reinforcement Learning Agent IRLA
- Develop algorithms for learning based on user interactions.
- self learning agents.
- movement algorithms based on input commands, adjusting for real-time feedback.
- errors, unrecognised inputs, mechanical faults, incorrect movements, power loss, recovery actions.
- LLM to run in a autonomy loop with sensory feedback 
  - real-time commands
  - interpret sensor data - server-client architecture/ cloud integration - 
  - send motor controls 
- obstacle avoidance, path planning, or even object detection using sensors like a camera.
- natural language commands to control the robot or adjust its autonomy.
- Integrate a microphone and speech-to-text
- 

### mint code
- fembot-monitor in mint code links to local LLM
- process variables from sensor readings,  then LLM responds and issues action commands to servos etc
- The `S` function simulates reading sensor data. In this example, it generates a random number between 0 and 99.
- The `A` function simulates sending data to the LLM and getting a response In a real time
it simply checks if the sensor reading is above 50.
- The `I` function interprets the AI response and decides on an action. In this simple example, it sets the action to 1 if the response is 1, and 0 otherwise.
- The `P` function performs the action, which in this case just prints "Moving forward" or "Stopping".
- The `M` function is the main loop that ties everything together. It continuously reads the sensor, gets an AI response, interprets it, and performs the action.

### To use 
-   MINT interpreter  main loop `M`.
- You'll see continuous output of sensor readings, AI responses, and actions.
- Replace the `S` function with actual sensor reading code.
- Modify the `A` function to make local LLM calls.
- Expand the `I` and `P` functions to handle more complex responses and actions.
- Add error handling and potentially more sophisticated control flow.
