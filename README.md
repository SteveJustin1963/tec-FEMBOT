6 of 9 is a female android and the ship's engineer in the animated science fiction series "Tripping the Rift." Her exceptional intelligence and ability to analyze complex situations and systems quickly make her an invaluable member of the crew. She possesses extensive knowledge of engineering and technology, which allows her to repair and modify the ship's systems as needed. Additionally, she is knowledgeable in scientific fields such as physics and astronomy, which proves vital to the crew's survival in dangerous situations. However, it's important to note that 6 of 9 is also a parody of Seven of Nine from Star Trek: Voyager. In the show, she is often depicted wearing revealing clothing and using her sexuality to manipulate others. In the episode "You Wanna Put That Where?" from the first season, 6 of 9 goes to a bar and dances on a table, which attracts the attention of a group of aliens who want to make cyborg copies of her. One of the aliens scans her body with a device to create a 3D model, which is used to create the copies.

## Gina Gershon
It is a common misconception that Gina Gershon, an American actress, was the model for the character 6 of 9 in "Tripping the Rift." However, this is not accurate. The character 6 of 9 is a computer-generated image, which means that she was created using 3D modeling software and not based on any particular real-life model or actress. The character was voiced by actress Jenny McCarthy, who provided the character's voice and personality throughout the series.
While Gershon did appear in the series as the voice of a different character, the show's creators have stated that she was not involved in the creation of 6 of 9's character design or modeling. Therefore, there is no connection between Gina Gershon and the creation of the character 6 of 9 in "Tripping the Rift."
