# tec-FEMBOT

 

As an avid tech enthusiast, I find myself enamored with a remarkable creationâ€”a female cyborg exquisitely crafted with anatomically precise silicon design. She surpasses the boundaries of being a mere robot and has evolved into something truly extraordinary, capturing my imagination.
 


## brain
- chatbot 
- gpt api 
- female text to voice (t2v)
- tec-brain
- voice command board that can recognize phrases and can invoke body movements

## body
- ai generated ideas, convert to sketch then cad
- 3d cad clean up mesh and slt to cardboard layers or clay modeling 
- plastic and metal skeletal, vacuum formed plastic skin panels
- 

## The construction 
of a fembot can vary depending on parts from other vendor or diy parts
- Some made of silicone, which is a durable and flexible material that can closely mimic the texture and feel of human skin. 
- Other made of TPE (thermoplastic elastomer), which is a softer and more affordable material that can also be used to create a realistic feel. 
- Some are solid 
- while others may have a hollow interior with a solid outer layer.
- some are frames with cover plates made of hard or soft part

## IRLA
interactive reinforcement learning agent using TensorFlow and OpenAI's Gym library. It appears that it may be attempting to simulate a scenario where a reinforcement learning agent interacts with users through GPT-3 while concurrently learning from a gym environment. The agent takes an action in the gym environment and gets feedback (reward) based on which it improves its policy.

Remember to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

A couple of additional points:

1. I've removed the lines about the `personality` object and `get_trait()` method, as they weren't defined anywhere in the code.
2. The `preprocess_state()` function that is supposed to transform the chat response into a state that the model can use is still not defined. You need to implement this function according to your specific use case.
3. The `evaluate_good_action()` and `evaluate_moral_action()` functions return `True` unconditionally after sleeping for 0.1 seconds. If these functions are supposed to perform actual evaluation of the actions, you should update them accordingly.
