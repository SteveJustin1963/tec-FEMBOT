# tec-FEMBOT

 

As an avid tech enthusiast, I find myself enamored with a remarkable creationâ€”a female cyborg exquisitely crafted with anatomically precise silicon design. She surpasses the boundaries of being a mere robot and has evolved into something truly extraordinary, capturing my imagination.

## The construction 
of a fembot can vary depending on parts from other vendor or diy parts
- Some made of silicone, which is a durable and flexible material that can closely mimic the texture and feel of human skin. 
- Other made of TPE (thermoplastic elastomer), which is a softer and more affordable material that can also be used to create a realistic feel. 
- Some are solid 
- while others may have a hollow interior with a solid outer layer.
- some are frames with cover plates made of hard or soft part
